Javascript runs synchroneous function first then it runs aynchroneous function

console.log("start")
const newFuc = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
    console.log(1)
    resolve("2")
})

newFunc.then((res) => {
    console.log(res)
})


EXPORT 
if we are creating a react function using default export than we can call it by any name but if we are only using export than we have to call it by its specific name.


function abcd (){
}
export default abcd;
import anyname from ./path

import {abcd} from "./path"
export function abcd (){
<></>
}


NOTE2-

we can also create elements in react using react.createElement 
ex- react.creatElement("h1",null,"sweta")


NOTE3

always set the State by using previous value but not current value.

setState((prevState) => prevState+1)
